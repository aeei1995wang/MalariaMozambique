The data files in this repository are for the paper "Bayesian Spatial Modelling of Geostatistical Data using INLA and SPDE methods: A Case Study Predicting Malaria Risk in Mozambique".

Prevalence survey data for Mozambique and selected covariates in surveyed locations (altitude \texttt{alt}, maximum temperature \texttt{temp}, precipitation \texttt{perc}, humidity \texttt{gum}, population density \texttt{pop} and distance to nearest inland water bodies \texttt{aqua}) are stored in data frame \texttt{d}.

Data frame \texttt{dp} specifies the locations where we wish to predict the prevalence together with values of covariates in these locations.
